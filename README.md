## Description
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. It also uses the Moment package to format timestamps.

## Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine and install the dependencies. 

## Usage
Invoke the application by running "npm start" and the models will sync to the database. Then use Insomnia to seed the database and test the routes. You can watch a walkthrough video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DhFdllPttuzyZNmkLTaC6ur6t_mH33ub/view)!
